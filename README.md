# belly-button-challenge

In this challenge an interactive dashboard is created to explore a belly button microbe dataset. 
This dashboard contains:
- An interactive drop down menu to select a sample
- A horizontal bar chart showing the top ten microbes or operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in each sample
- A bubble chart showing all the microbes present in each sample
- A panel that displays the demographic information for each sample.  

The plots and the demographic info panel update automatically when a new sample number is chosen.

The [html code](https://github.com/chelseapickett/belly-button-challenge/blob/main/index.html) for the website was provided in the starter code although a small change was made to achieve consistency with the javascript code. 

The [javascript code](https://github.com/chelseapickett/belly-button-challenge/blob/main/static/js/app.js) can be found in the app.js file located in the 'static/js' folder. 

The [belly button diversity dashboard](https://chelseapickett.github.io/belly-button-challenge/) is hosted on Github pages.
